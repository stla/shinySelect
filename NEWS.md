# shinySelect 1.3.0

Fixed `updateSelectControlInput`, which was totally buggy.


# shinySelect 1.2.0

There was a bug when there was only one HTML choice in the widget.


# shinySelect 1.1.0

In the previous version, in order to update the selected values with 
`updateSelectControlInput`, the user had to give the `choices` argument in 
addition to the `selected` argument. This is no longer necessary.


# shinySelect 1.0.0

First release.
